= Composite Resources
:RFC6902: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6902.txt

Many of the resources specified for the external API serve no purpose
but to contain other, more specific resources.  These _composite
resources_ usually collect a group of resources related by feature,
service, or ownership.

== Simple composite resources

To shorten the specification, we often describe a resource's behaviour
under some or all methods as being 'as a simple composite resource'.
Informally, this means that actions distribute over the children of
the resource.  More specifically:

* The `GET` representation of the resource *should* be an object whose
  keys are the names of resource children the client has authorisation
  to `GET`, and whose corresponding values are the `GET`
  representations of said children;
* A `PUT` action, with a payload consisting of an object of child
  representations as described above, *should* be equivalent to a
  `PUT` for each child present in the object (with its intended new
  representation), and a `DELETE` for each absent child;
* A `PATCH` action *may* be accepted, provided it follows
  {RFC6902}[RFC 6902]: the behaviours of the `add`, `remove`, and
  `replace` operations *should* then map onto `PUT`, `DELETE`, and
  `PUT` (to an existing resource) respectively;
* A `POST` action *should* always fail, as no new resources can be
  added.

Other actions *should not* be added.
