= External API
:REST: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm
:features: link:../../features/README.adoc

The BAPS3 internal API is mainly intended for use when joining servers
together to form services.  While it is possible to connect clients to
services using the internal API, we also specify a resource-based
_external API_ intended for consumption specifically by clients.

The external API uses HTTPS as an underlying protocol, and is based on
the concept of projecting the visible state of a service as a resource
hierarchy, with HTTP verbs representing the possible interactions with
said resources.  This approach is inspired by the
{REST}[Representational State Transfer] school of API design.

== Resources
BAPS3 {features}[features] *may* define a number of _resources_ that
participate in the external API.  Resources are represented in the
external API as elements in the URL hierarchy: a playlist service, for
example, will define, through its constituent features, a 'playlist'
resource and zero or more playlist items, at 'playlist/0' onwards.
HTTPS requests on these resources could either represent a query on
the internal state of the service, or an equivalent Internal API
request (for example, a DELETE on 'playlist/0' might represent a
'dequeue 0' internal API command).

== Rationale

We define a separate external API because:

* HTTPS is a ubiquitous protocol and is implemented in more areas than
  the bespoke internal API protocol;
* Web clients can make easier use of a HTTPS-based protocol than a raw
  TCP-based protocol;
* Allows for simple authentication of requests, using the existing
  HTTP authentication framework;
* The resource-hierarchy view of BAPS3 is easier to inspect and query
  (for both debug and production purposes) than a command-based view.
