= Feature: Seek

Provides the `seek` request, for changing the audio position.

== Dependencies

The audio handled by servers implementing `Seek` *should* be seekable.
`Seek` provides no means of handling or detecting unseekable audio,
except returning failure from a `seek` request.

== Conflicts

`Seek` may conflict with other seeking features.

== Requests

=== `seek` â€” change position

==== Synopsis

`seek <MICROS>`

==== Description

Seeks the currently playing audio to `MICROS` microseconds.  `MICROS`
*must* be a non-negative integer for the `seek` request to be
considered valid.

The position after `seek` *should* be the closest possible position
to `MICROS`.  If the position is past the end of audio, the server
*should* behave as if the audio had ended of its own accord.

The new position *may* be reported, for example via the `TIME`
response, but this is outside the scope of this feature.
