Bifrost is comprised of multiple logical _roles_.  Each role
is intended to be implemented as a separate server program, but
*may* be merged (for reasons of performance, maintainability, and
so on).

== Core Roles

Bifrost specifies six _core roles_:

* {player}[`player/file`];
* {list}[`list`];
* {tracklister}[`tracklister`];
* {db}[`db`];
* {mux}[`mux`].

== Additional Roles

Bifrost implementations *may* define additional roles.  Examples of
possible roles _not_ specified here include:

* Digitising and cataloguing roles;
* Installation, deployment and configuration roles.

Non-standard roles **must** begin with the prefix `x/`.
