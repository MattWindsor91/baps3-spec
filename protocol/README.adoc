This chapter of the specification defines the _Bifrost protocol_: the
set of conventions Bifrost-compatible clients and servers use to
communicate.

== Structure

The Bifrost protocol is split into several stages:

* the {msgproto}[Message Protocol], which defines the basic protocol
  on top of TCP used by Bifrost;
* the {core}[Core Protocol], which defines the structure and content
  of messages (_requests_ and _responses_) used in Bifrost clients and
  servers;
* the {roles}[Roles], which define packages of requests and responses
  that define part of a Bifrost system.

We also discuss Bifrost's mechanisms for {changes}[changing and
extending] the protocol.
