= Compliance Tests

In this chapter, we provide test case outlines for testing compliance
of BAPS3 implementations.  Implementors *may* use these as a basis for
automated compliance testing.  Note that these tests are _not_
intended to be exhaustive.

Where possible, each test case is given in the following format:

* A unique identifier to allow tracing from specified test to
  implemented unit tests;
* A set of inputs that should be posed to the component under test;
* A set of outputs that should be returned from said component;
* A description of the particular behaviour under test.
