==== Synopsis

`END`

==== Description

`END` *should* be sent when:

* The current state is `Playing`; *and*
* The current audio source (stream or file) has reached its end; *and*
* The audio end is not due to any request from upstream (the end was
  not caused by a `stop`, `eject`, or `quit` request, for instance).

`END` *may* be used as a signal to perform some action on the end
of an audio source.  For example, implementations of `AutoAdvance`
*should* use `END` as a trigger to set up the auto-advance.
