= Feature: Seek

Provides the `seek` request, for changing the audio position.

== Dependencies

The audio handled by servers implementing `Seek` *should* be seekable.
`Seek` provides no means of handling or detecting unseekable audio,
except returning failure from a `seek` request.

== Conflicts

`Seek` may conflict with other seeking features.

== Requests

=== `seek` â€” change position

==== Synopsis

`seek <MICROS>`

==== Description

Seeks the currently playing audio to `MICROS` microseconds.  `MICROS`
*must* be a non-negative integer for the `seek` request to be
considered valid.

The position after `seek` *should* be the closest possible position
to `MICROS`.  If the position is past the end of audio, the server
*should* behave as if the audio had ended of its own accord.

The new position *may* be reported, for example via the `TIME`
response, but this is outside the scope of this feature.

== Resources

=== `/player`

Resource group for player-related resources.  Behaves as a simple composite resource.  If defined in other features, treat as if singly defined.

=== `/player/position`

The current position within the audio.

==== `GET`

Unless defined otherwise in other implemented features, the server *must* respond to `GET` with the nil payload.

==== `PUT`

Given an integral payload, this *should* behave as equivalent to the `seek` Internal API request with the given integer as the new microsecond position.

Given the nil payload, this *should* behave as if 0 was supplied.

Other payloads, including string representations of numbers, *should* be rejected.

==== `DELETE`

As `PUT` with the nil payload.
