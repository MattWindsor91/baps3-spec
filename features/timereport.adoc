== Responses

=== `TIME` â€” current time

==== Synopsis

`TIME <MICROS>`

==== Description

Reports the current position in the audio as being `MICROS`
microseconds.  `MICROS` *must* be a non-negative integer for the
`TIME` response to be considered valid.

The `TIME` response *should* be sent as part of the server's _initial
responses_, if it is currently playing audio.  It *may* be sent by
the server at any time, and *should* ideally be sent at a periodic
rate of less than one second to allow clients to update their
position counters in a smooth manner.
