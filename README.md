# BAPS3 Specification

This is the specification for the BAPS3 playout system.  It may be read directly
as a directory of _Markdown_ files, or compiled to book format.

The latest version of the specification may be found at its [GitHub
repository][] at all times.  A [pre-rendered copy][] is available via GitHub
Pages, but may lag behind the main repository.

The specification is licenced under the [CC0][] licence; that is, it is under
the public domain.  In the repository, this is available as the file `LICENSE`.

When browsed as a repository, the _summary_ of the specification may be found at
`SUMMARY.md`.  In book form, this is available as a side-bar.

Queries and comments on the specification should be made, when appropriate, on
its GitHub [issues][] page.
