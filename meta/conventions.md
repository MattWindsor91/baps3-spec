% Conventions used in this document

We adopt several conventions in the BAPS3 specification.

## Typographical Conventions

We use the following typographical conventions:

* __Bold text__ is used either as a paragraph heading, or to introduce a
  key word with special meaning (see below);
* _Italics_ are used for emphasis;
* `Fixed-width type` is used for command words, code snippets, and other
  text intended to be consumed by a computer.

## RFC 2119 Key Words

The key words __must__, __must not__, __required__, __shall__, __shall not__,
__should__, __should not__, __recommended__,  __may__, and __optional__ in this
document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

Note that the RFC 2119 key words are highlighted in this document by the use
of __bold face__, as opposed to the capitalisation suggested in RFC 2119.  Any
instance of such a key word that is not in bold is not intended to be
interpreted as per the RFC.
