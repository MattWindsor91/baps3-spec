:rfc: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt

We adopt several conventions in this document.

== Typographical Conventions

We use the following typographical conventions:

* *Bold text* is used either as a paragraph heading, or to introduce a
  key word with special meaning (see below);
* _Italics_ are used for emphasis;
* `Fixed-width type` is used for command words, code snippets, and other
  text intended to be consumed by a computer.

== RFC 2119 Key Words

The key words *must*, *must not*, *required*, *shall*, *shall not*,
*should*, *should not*, *recommended*,  *may*, and *optional* in this
document are to be interpreted as described in {rfc}[RFC 2119].

Note that the RFC 2119 key words are highlighted in this document by the use
of *bold face*, as opposed to the capitalisation suggested in RFC 2119.  Any
instance of such a key word that is not in bold is not intended to be
interpreted as per the RFC.
