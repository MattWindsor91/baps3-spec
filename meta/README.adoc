This document specifies the Bifrost protocol and playout architecture.
It is designed to be compiled using {gitbook}[gitbook].

It is, currently, a _living specification_.  It will change
dramatically and without warning, as Bifrost is designed and
implemented.  Hopefully, when the reference implementations are
finished, the specification will be frozen and usable as a reference
for future Bifrost work.
