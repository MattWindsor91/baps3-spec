This document is the specification for University Radio York's BAPS3
playout suite.  It is written with the intention of being compilable
using {gitbook}[gitbook].

It is, currently, a _living specification_.  It will change
dramatically and without warning, as BAPS3 is designed and implemented.
Hopefully, when the reference implementations are finished, the
specification will be frozen and usable as a reference for future
BAPS3 work.
