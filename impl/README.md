# Reference Implementations

URY is in the process of programming _reference implementations_ of the BAPS3
services:

* [playslave++](https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork/playslave-plusplus), a
  C++ implementation of the player service;
* [listmaster](https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork/listmaster), a Rust
  implementation of the playlist service;
* [bra](https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork/bra), a Ruby implementation of
  the platform service;
* A Web implementation of the client is being created as part of
  [MyRadio](https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork/MyRadio).

These will form part of a full implementation of BAPS3 for use in URY.
