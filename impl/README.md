# Reference Implementations

URY is in the process of programming _reference implementations_ of the BAPS3
services:

* [URY playd][], a C++ implementation of the player service;
* [listmaster][], a Rust implementation of the playlist service;
* [URY rapid][], a Ruby implementation of the platform service;
* A Web implementation of the client is being created as part of
  [MyRadio][](https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork/MyRadio).

These will form part of a full implementation of BAPS3 for use in URY.
