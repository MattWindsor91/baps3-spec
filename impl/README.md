# Reference Implementations

URY is in the process of programming _reference implementations_ of the BAPS3
services:

* [playd], a C++ implementation of the player service;
* [listd], a Rust implementation of the playlist service;
* [Bifrost], a Go implementation of the platform service;
* [COPD], a C++ GUI implementing a client.

These will form part of a full implementation of BAPS3 for use in URY.
