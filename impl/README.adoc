URY is in the process of programming _reference implementations_
of the BAPS3 services:

* {playd}[playd], a C++ implementation of the player service;
* {listd}[listd], a Rust implementation of the playlist service;
* {Bifrost}[Bifrost], a Go implementation of the platform service;
* {COPD}[COPD], a C++ GUI implementing a client.

These will form part of a full implementation of BAPS3 for use in
URY.
