# Rationale

_BAPS3_ is an architecture for a radio playout suite, designed to replace the
playout suite, _BAPS2_, in use at University Radio York as of 2014.  As such, it
is primarily designed to build on the successes, and avoid the failures, of that
system.

The primary goals for BAPS3 are:

* To replace BAPS2 in use at University Radio York;
* To be easily modifiable, replaceable, and extensible;
* To take advantage of modern software, hardware and development technology;
* To be cross-platform (specifically focusing on Windows, Linux and FreeBSD);
* To be as reliable as, or more reliable than, BAPS2.

In addition to this, we hope that BAPS3 will:

* Be useful to other small (voluntary, community and student) radio stations;
* Be adaptable to the changing world of student radio;
* Allow a greater amount of flexibility within University Radio York than is
  currently available with BAPS2.
